Before Catalina the kindlegen 32 bits for Linux worked flawlessly on MacOS, but after Catalina and the new standard of
64 bits only, the specific binary was needed for MacOS.

Funny enough, Amazon didn't published the 64 bits at the their website until the date I'm writing this txt.
The workaround I found was to download the Kindle Previewer MacOS application (program for authors to preview the
Kindle mobi version of their book), and grab the 64 bits binary directly from the Library directory where the Previewer
is installed.
